# Language Recognition

This project was developed at the Polytechnic School of the University of SÃ£o Paulo for a lecture about Artificial Neural Networks.

Here was used Multilayer Perceptron approach, the source is available in the ```src``` folder. We lost the original version because that we did reverse engineering over the compiled version.

To run:
```sh
java -cp langrecog.jar:jcommon-1.0.9.jar:jfreechart-1.0.5.jar br.usp.poli.ann.gui.LanguageRecognition
```
